# Security Assessment Portfolio

This repository contains structured security assessment write-ups created in a bug bounty style.  
The focus is on **methodology**, **API reconnaissance**, and **access-control validation** with strict respect for scope and ethical boundaries.

## What you will find here
- Step-by-step security assessments (including “no findings” reports)
- Clear reasoning and testing constraints
- Reproducible, non-destructive request patterns (read-only where applicable)
- Practical notes that demonstrate how I approach real-world security work

## Testing principles
- Work strictly within program scope and rules
- No brute-force, no DoS, no social engineering
- No state-changing actions unless explicitly allowed
- Prefer **manual, methodical validation** over noisy automation
- Automation is used only to reduce repetition (not to replace analysis)

## Assessments
